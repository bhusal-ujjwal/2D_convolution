# 2D Convolution of Image using C++ and cuda
- Create a kernel for a graphic card by using the CUDA API using shared memory.

## Features
- The kernel will take an image copied from a host and apply an effect to it using convolution masks.
- Create an application that is able to perform three different 2D convolutions over an image. 
- For simplicity, use the same dimensions across various masks. 
- Masks can be chosen as desired (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)).
